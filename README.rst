What is HyperShop
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At the root of HyperShop is a shopping list hypernim extractor for matching item category to supermarket section.

It takes in a shopping list (e.g manually enterred, or from a TODO app like Trello), categorizes the items (with user prompts in case of unclear items), and
re-orders the list to group the categories together. The categories themselves are ordered according a given supermarket layout and the path you choose to take.
